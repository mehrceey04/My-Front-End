					<h3 align="center">7 Tips for Perfect Eyebrows</h3>
      		<h3 align="center">How to Get Arches You'll Love</h3>
    		<div><h3 style="margin-top: 25px; text-align: left">Shape is Everything</h3>
    			<p>Perfectly groomed eyebrows pull your look together in a snap. And in all honesty, very few people have a naturally perfect brow. (Except my husband, which is totally not fair being a guy and all.) Eyebrows, like hair color and length, require upkeep, but the results are so worth it. There is nothing like the day after you get your brows done, when the redness is gone and you look like you got an eye lift.</p>
      		<p>Here are 7 tips on keeping your brows perfectly groomed at all times.</p>
      		<div><ul><li><strong>Start with a Professional</strong>: Sure, you can groom your eyebrows by yourself, but you'll get a much better job when you pay to have it down. When you are lying back, the technician can easily and evenly shape your brows in a resting, natural position. Plus, it costs a lot to go in for a professional color job or cut but a professional brow grooming is only around $15 to $20. Totally worth it.</li><li><strong>Put the Messy Popsicle Stick Down</strong>: Getting your brows done doesn't have to mean waxing.Threading is hotter than ever and you'll probably have no problems finding someone local to do it. There is less redness and it's faster and far more precise than waxing. Added bonus: It's usually cheaper! Plus, unlike waxing, you don't need to really grow out your brows so there is enough hair for the wax to stick and pull out so outgrowth is minimal. We're never going back to waxing our brows again.</li>
          <li><strong>Upkeep at Home</strong>: Once they are done by the professional, you can easily keep the shape at home when the stragglers start coming in. Take a minute each night before bed to tweeze out the ones that grow back quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Invest in a Good Tweezers</strong>: Pass on the dollar store tweezers and get a Tweezerman.(compare prices). The cheap tweezers are notorious at breaking the hair instead of pulling it out. You'll be surprised how easy a good pair of tweezers can pull out a hair without breaking it.</li>
          <li><strong>Skip the Brow Fads</strong>: Tell me honestly, did anyone<em>really</em>like thebig brow look of 2011? And just as bad are the barely-there brows. Fads are just fads, but a professional can take the natural shape of your brows and give them the perfect arch.</li>
        	</ul>
      	</div>
      	<p>It's true, shape is the most important thing - everyone can benefit from a brow shaping. Once shaped, however, it's time to make them pop. Here are some ways to get even more from your brows.</p>
      	<div>
        	<ul><li><strong>Brush Them Into Place</strong>: Each morning, using a brow brush or a soft toothbrush, brush your brows into place. It will take all of two seconds and will leave them perfectly placed. Some people recommend using clear mascara or even a bit of hairspray sprayed onto the toothbrush to keep them in place all day long.</li>
          <li><strong>Sparse brows? Fill Them In</strong>: But it can be tricky to do this. Put down the pencil which can leave obvious darkening and sometimes, depending on how heavy handed you are, can leave obvious pencil lines. Get some mineral makeup that matches your brow color (try Mineral Hygienics) and a makeup brush made just for your brows (We like and fill them in.</li>
          <li><strong>Use a Highlighter</strong>: Putting a bit of highlighter right under the arch of your brow will accentuate the brow bone, leaving you looking younger and your eyes looking bigger. Benefit Cosmetics: High Brow gets stellar reviews. Super easy with major results.</li>
        	</ul>
      	</div>
      	<h3>Upkeep</h3>
      	<p>If you keep the stragglers that come in early at bay with nightly tweezing, a brow wax or threading can last a good month or more. Some people can keep the shape at home with at home waxing, as well, but we recommend just making a reoccurring monthly (more or less depending on growth) stop at the mall for a professional upkeep, especially if you let them all grow throughout the month.</p>
      	<p>There really is nothing as inexpensive in the beauty world that can make such a drastic difference in your appearance. You'll look more put together and feel beautiful each month by this simple commitment to yourself.</p>
